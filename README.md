# Logic gates sequence finder
In this assignment, I have implemented genetic algorithms to solve the logic gates sequence-finding problem.
I have used multiple hyperparameters such as initial population, crossover probability, and mutation probability.  

The algorithm follows the bellow sequence:
1. population selection
2. crossover
3. mutation
4. checking for the end condition
